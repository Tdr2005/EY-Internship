    <p>
        Dal bati is a popular Rajasthani dish that is a staple food in the state. It is a combination of two main components: <br>
        Dal: This is a spicy lentil stew, typically made with toor dal (pigeon peas) or moong dal (green gram). It is cooked with a blend of spices like cumin, coriander, chili powder, and turmeric. <br>
        Bati: These are hard, round wheat balls that are baked in an oven or on an open fire. They are made from a dough of wheat flour, ghee, and sometimes yogurt. <br>
        How it's eaten: <br>
        The bati is traditionally broken into pieces and dipped into the dal before being eaten. It can also be served with: <br>
        Churma: A sweet dish made by crushing the leftover bati and mixing it with sugar, ghee, and sometimes dry fruits. <br>
        Pickle: A tangy pickle, often mango or lemon, adds a refreshing flavor to the dish. <br>
        Salad: A simple salad of onions and tomatoes complements the spicy dal and the rich bati. <br>
