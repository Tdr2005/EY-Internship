        Dosa is a traditional South Indian dish made from a fermented batter of rice and lentils. It is a thin, crispy crepe made from a fermented batter of ground black gram (urad dal) and rice. Dosas are typically served hot with sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew) and chutney. <br>

        There are many different types of dosas, each with its own unique flavor and texture. Some of the most popular varieties include: <br>
        
        Masala dosa: This is the most common type of dosa, filled with a spiced potato mixture. <br>
        Plain dosa: This is a simple dosa made with only the basic batter. <br>
        Paper dosa: This is a very thin and crispy dosa. <br>
        Rava dosa: This dosa is made with semolina (rava) instead of rice. <br>
        Onion dosa: This dosa is filled with chopped onions. <br>
